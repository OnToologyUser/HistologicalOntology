Histological Ontology

The histological ontology is developed following an existing methodology using Conceptual Models (CMs) and validated using OOPS!, expert
evaluation with CMs, and how accurately the ontology can answer the Competency Questions (CQ).

We left the histological ontology publicly available at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/HO, the documentation at https://w3id.org/def/System and the OWL files at https:
